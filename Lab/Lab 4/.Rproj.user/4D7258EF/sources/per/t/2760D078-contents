**Objective**: Examine the association between weekly average dew point and wind speed in four regions of the US and by elevation.

### 1) Read in data

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)

met <- read.csv("~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-tellorin@usc.edu/.shortcut-targets-by-id/10yI1Vp2x44iBX7T-_NfWNeL7go8kwnUH/2. College - USC/1. Degree/1. Courses/Y4 Senior/Fall 2025/PM 566/Lab/GitHub-Lab-Repository/Lab 3/data/met_all.gz")
met <- data.table::fread("met_all.gz")
```

### 2) Preparing data

```{r}
met <- met[temp > -17][elev == 9999.0, elev := NA]
met[, week := week(as.Date(paste(year, month, day, sep = "-")))]
met <- met[week == min(week, na.rm = TRUE)]

met_avg <- met[,.(temp=mean(temp,na.rm=TRUE), rh=mean(rh,na.rm=TRUE), 
                  wind.sp=mean(wind.sp,na.rm=TRUE), 
                  vis.dist=mean(vis.dist,na.rm=TRUE), 
                  dew.point = mean(dew.point, na.rm=TRUE), lat=mean(lat), 
                  lon=mean(lon), 
                  elev=mean(elev,na.rm=TRUE)), by="USAFID"]

met_avg$elev_cat <- ifelse(met_avg$elev> 252, "high", "low")

met_avg$region <- ifelse(met_avg$lon > -98 & met_avg$lat >39.71, "north east",
                         ifelse(met_avg$lon > -98 & met_avg$lat < 39.71, 
                                "south east",
                                ifelse(met_avg$lon < -98 & met_avg$lat >39.71, 
                                       "north west", "south west")))

table(met_avg$region)
```

### 3) Examine relative humidity and dew point by region

The plots show higher dew points in the **`northeast`** and `southeast` along with elevated relative humidity levels in that region. In contrast, dew point measurements in the `northwest` and `southwest` regions have much more variable distributions and have a lower median for relative humidity.

```{r}
met_avg %>%
  filter(!(dew.point %in% NA)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_violin (mapping = aes(y=dew.point, x=1))+
  facet_wrap(~region, nrow = 2)

met_avg %>%
  filter(!(dew.point %in% NA)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y=rh, fill=region)) +
  facet_wrap(~region, nrow=2)
```

### 4) Examine association between dew point and relative humidity

The plot shows a strong positive relationship between dew point and relative humidity across all regions. All region's regression lines have upward slopes, indicating that as dew point increases, relative humidity also increases. The relationship appears strongest in the `southeast` and `northeast` regions, while the `northwest` and `southwest` regions show more variability and dispersion around the trend line.

```{r}
met_avg %>%
  filter(!(region %in% NA)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=dew.point, y= rh, color=region))+
  geom_jitter() + 
  stat_smooth(method=lm)
```

### 5) Barplots of weather stations by elevation

The bar chart shows significant differences in weather station distribution across regions and elevation categories. The `southeast` region has the highest number of stations overall, concentrated specifically in low elevations. The `northeast` region shows more stations at high elevations compared to `northwest`. The `northwest` region has the fewest total stations but shows a stronger presence in high elevations.

```{r}
met_avg %>%
  filter(!(region %in% NA)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=elev_cat,fill=region), position = "dodge")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuOr")+
  labs(title="Number of weather stations by elevation category and region", 
       x="Elevation Category", y= "Count")+
  theme_bw()
```

### 6) Examine mean dew point and wind speed by region

The region with the highest mean dew point is the `southeast`, at \~22°C. The `northwest` region has the lowest mean dew point, at \~13°C. The error bars show that the `northwest` region has the most variable conditions, while the `southeast` region has more consistent dew point values across stations.

Regional differences in wind speed are less variable compared to dew point patterns. The `southwest` and `northwest` regions show higher mean wind speeds. The `southeast` and `northeast` regions show lower mean wind speeds. All regions have similar variability in wind speeds.

```{r}
met_avg %>%
  filter(!(region %in% NA)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=region, y=dew.point)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data="mean_sdl", geom="errorbar") +
  stat_summary(fun.data="mean_sdl")

met_avg %>%
filter(!(region %in% NA)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=region, y=wind.sp)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data="mean_sdl", geom="errorbar") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data="mean_sdl")
```

### 7) Spatial trends in relative humidity in the U.S.

The map shows a clear east-to-west gradient across the U.S. Eastern and some coastal regions show higher relative humidity values (above 70%), represented by red and magenta colors. The central regions show moderate mix of humidity levels, while the western regions show lower values. The top 5% locations with the highest relative humidity are scattered in the coastal and central regions.

```{r}
met_avg2<-met_avg[!is.na(rh)]

top5 <- met_avg2[rank(-rh) <= 10]

rh_pal = colorNumeric(c('blue','purple','red'), domain=met_avg2$rh)
leaflet(met_avg2) %>%
  addProviderTiles('OpenStreetMap') %>%
  addCircles(lat=~lat, lng=~lon, color=~rh_pal(rh), 
             label=~paste0(round(rh,2), ' rh'), opacity=1,fillOpacity=1, 
             radius=500) %>%
  addMarkers(lat=~lat, lng=~lon, label=~paste0(round(rh,2), ' rh'), 
             data = top5) %>%
  addLegend('bottomleft',pal=rh_pal, values=met_avg2$rh, 
            title="Relative Humidity", opacity=1)
```

### 8) Plot of choice: Average temperature by region

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtext)

ggplot(met_avg, aes(x = region, y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue", color = "navyblue") +
  labs(
    title = "<b>Average Temperature by Region</b><br>
    <span style='font-size:10pt'>This plot compares mean temperatures across U.S. regions.<br>
    <span style='color:darkred;'>Note:</span> Regions are based on latitude and longitude cutoffs.</span>",
    x = "Region<br><span style='font-size:8pt'>Defined by lat/lon thresholds</span>",
    y = "Temperature (°C)<br><span style='font-size:8pt'>Averaged across each weather station</span>"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.title = element_textbox_simple(
      size = 13,
      lineheight = 1.2,
      padding = margin(6, 6, 6, 6),
      margin = margin(0, 0, 8, 0),
      fill = "lightyellow"
    ),
    axis.title.x = element_textbox_simple(
      padding = margin(4, 4, 4, 4),
      margin = margin(6, 0, 0, 0),
      fill = "azure1"
    ),
    axis.title.y = element_textbox_simple(
      orientation = "left-rotated",
      padding = margin(4, 4, 4, 4),
      margin = margin(0, 0, 6, 0),
      fill = "lightsteelblue1"
    )
  )
```
